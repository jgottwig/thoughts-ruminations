When on thursday, she called me
(Me, on the balcony with coffee
watching jogging--those
blonde ponytails bobbing,
plus ass and thighs, and
the ocean, a vail, mine,
I think. She called, and when
I picked up the phone, she asked
and I told the truth--then,
that time. Yes, I'd seen her, and
yes, she'd seen me--full bar,
hordourves, but she wasn't
with me. Just seeing her is enough,
she said. Sometimes we watched
together, the ocean, then,
less a veil and more
a rage, and along the boardwalk
families with ice cream,
with dogs. I let her confess
but asked why.
To prove that people can be honest with one another,
she said,
and I picked that the fuck apart.
Me and my self-educated, self-medicated
philosophy. Jesus.
But this is not confessional.
Ours was always transaction after
transaction, something for Sundays,
whatever promises we might keep.)
