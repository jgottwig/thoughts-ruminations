Fingers so damn frozen, but God,
it's hot.  "Say again!
I'm not getting it!" QB screams.
I'm done with him.  We all are.
Fresh out of school, and he was good back then, but give
him an endorsement and he forgets how to throw.
What's he worth to you now, moneybags?
O and Five with time to improve, maybe.
I'm thinking he should fall funny.
Open things for the backup.
Can't be any worse.
Maybe I'll help him with that.
Little nudge next time
he hands it off.  Oops.  They'd call it friendly fire.
Nothing friendly about it when it comes from me.
But I ain't like that.  Give a man a chance or five.
Make that six.  Hell, I'll give him twelve.
Season's lost, best I can tell.
Best not lose my career.
