Lazarus
by Jeremy Gottwig

Lazarus learned to live the night he 
met Mary in that downtown
nightclub.  Some called it physics: an
ocular attraction that drew two powerful
poles into one fundamental
quark.  Those that knew them best sensed
radioactivity in their moves;
saw fallout in their future.  But beneath the strobes,
those dancers remained innocent, balanced
upon the threshold of unborn years.
