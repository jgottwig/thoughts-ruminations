Coffee
by Jeremy Gottwig

I wonder why
that fly persists to flip
between the window and my
mug.  The coffee
smells like piss and tastes
like piss plus something
not-quite-sugar.  Maybe the fly
enjoys morning memories of 
sex and fights over
furniture and still pretends
to like
her coffee
like I still do
after all these years.

Or maybe
this fly, like any
other fly
just enjoys
the taste
of piss.
