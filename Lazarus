Lazarus LIVED the night he met
Mary in that downtown
nightclub.  Some called it physics: some
ocular attraction that drew two
poles into one fundamental
quark.  Those that knew them best sensed
radioactivity in their dance;
saw fission and fallout in their future.
Together, their twisted shapes shadows stayed innocent
upon the threshold of years.
